# Requirements:
- The first is the creation of a secure connection for each employee to connect to the Azure network. This will 
require the deployment of a secure VPN tunnel.  
- The second component is the creation of a backup plan to ensure each employeeâ€™s data are backed up on the 
Cloud regularly. Specifically, you must schedule backups to occur every Friday at 10:59 PM, with a retention 
period of two weeks. Additionally, you must schedule backups to occur at the end of each month, with a 
retention period of six months.
- Resource group named <StudentName>-s243-RG, where StudentName is your name. 
- Assigned CIDR Block: 172.16.111.0/24
- From the Azure environment, create a scheduled backup plan to back up the <StudentID>-Files folder 
every Friday at 10:59 PM and at the end of each month with a retention of two weeks and six 
months, respectively.
- To verify your solution, you can manually back up files from the <yourname> folder to the Cloud and then 
restore files from the Cloud directly to the "Restored files" folder.
